# ESP32Focuser
Focuser for astronomy telescope based on ESP32 controller. Comportable with Indilib (http://indilib.org/) and ASCOM (https://ascom-standards.org/).
The controller uses the protocol Moonlite (as documented in the indilib project).

This is a port of an awesome code from https://github.com/Hansastro/Focuser to ESP32 platform.
